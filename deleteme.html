			<h2>About Dogmark</h2>
			<p>We firmly believe that a clothing brand should not be worn as a status symbol. Instead, we feel that a genuine brand should be an instant synonym for comfortable and exceptional wear, a positive brand fully committed to innovation, exploration of new styles and in constant pursuit of original designs, fits and patterns.</p>
			<p>In other words, we created The Dogmark brand to cater to everyone ready to live their life to the fullest, surrounded by friends, immersed in love and happiness, intolerant to discrimination and never willing to waste a single moment in order to indulge their own egos.</p>
			<p>Once we realized that the founding ideas behind Dogmark and our early collections were gaining recognition among the fashion aficionados with similar life philosophy, we boldly crossed the ocean and introduced The Dogmark brand to many European countries in 1995.</p>
			<p>Still true to our founding ideas, Dogmark has become a growing global family of designers and friendly staff from all corners of the world brought together by their common and unreserved dedication to the FEEL ALIVE philosophy.</p>
			
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>The Dogmark brand was established in California in 1992 by a group of young designers determined to launch a brand that would capture the upbeat California lifestyle and its unique freedom of spirit.</p>
			<p>As a reminder that the essence of life is to enjoy and experience rather than possess, The Dogmark brand ultimately evolved as a reaction against the hectic pace of life and impersonal style imposed by giant fashion corporations chasing their profit figures at the cost of creativity and freedom of fashion trends.</p>
			<p>From the very beginning, we have been working toward a simple goal: to create a friendly and affordable brand that embodies the unique free spirit and upbeat California lifestyle and reminds us to live our lives to the fullest.</p>
			<p>With all that in mind, the choice of Dogmark for our brand name transpred organically, along with Feel Alive as our slogan, urging us to enjoy and celebrate life and find happiness in everything we do.</p>
			
			<h2>Brand philosophy</h2>
			<p>The guiding philosophy behind all Dogmark collections is deeply rooted in the free spirit and attitude of the forever young Californian lifestyle.</p>
			<p>FEEL ALIVE and live the long endless summer, whether cruising along the golden California coast or hanging out with your friends, itâ€™s up to you.</p>
			<h2>Mission</h2>
			<p>We make clothes for people, who demand contemporary casual wear and expect highest quality and a fit that best complements their bodies, not supermodels.</p>
